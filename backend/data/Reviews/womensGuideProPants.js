      title: "Love these pants",
      review: "Love these pants for travel, but also wear them instead of jeans. They are comfortable and fit well and look good. I can wear them with a top and scarf and wear then to a nice restaurant. I have bought 8 pairs and they are my go to pants. I am normally a size 4 but wear a size 2 in these pants.. They are expensive but I usually get them when they are on sale.",

      title: "My favorite pants",
      review: "These are my new favorite pants. Now that I'm working from home, I wear these almost every day. They're stretchy and comfortable and shed water and stains, which is great for a parent of a young child like me, who often ends up with food on them. My son was getting in the car and stepped on my knee with his muddy shoes, and the mud wiped right off! Amazing. They also wash easily and go right in the dryer. I have them in 5 colors now, but the indigo and slate green are my favorites.",

      title: "Great pants - but why the logo on the leg?",
      review: "Switched to these pants from the Horizon (you changed the rise on them - and Horizons are now too low rise for me). Please don't change the fit on these Guide Pants - they are great. Love the fabric and the fit. Took one star off for the \"look\" because of the logo prominently displayed on the leg - in a contrasting colour. If it wasn't for this - these pants could double as dress pants. However, everything else is perfect - so am trying to pretend it's not there. Please get rid of the logo (or at least put is somewhere less visible ) - and these pants are perfect.",

      title: "nice pants",
      review: "I am 5'9\", 122 lbs. I ordered size 2 and size 4 reg. The 2 fit well, one 4 fit the same as the 2 did. So, the sizing varies within the same size. One 4 fit and one did not. I ordered a few pairs and found some that fit and sent some back which is a pain since it takes so long to get a replacement or a refund! But they are comfortable and the fabric feels like it will be durable and cool for summer activities.",

      review: "I do landscaping and I needed a good pair of flexible sturdy pants I usually wear between a 10 and 12. I decided to purchase a 12 because I had gain some weight over the winter. The 12's fit a little loose but it is exactly the way I like them. I love the feel of the material they are very well made and I will definitely be purchasing more from Go Far.",

      review: "Truly wonderful to find pants with both hip pockets and cargo pockets. And they were reasonably sized pockets too! The pants are well made. The fabric is excellent quality. i was really sad they didn't fit. I have a straight shape and they fit well in the waist. But sadly the thighs were huge which left flaps of fabric along the outside of each leg.",

      title: "Weird fit, like all EB pants.",
      review: "The fit on EB pants is very variable and strange. These were too tight in the thigh, too loose in the calf, and just seemed to sit weirdly on the waist and hips. Also the fabric is very stiff and thick. Seemed like it would be super hot to hike in them, which was the intended use. Back they went.",
