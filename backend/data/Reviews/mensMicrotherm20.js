      comment: "Over the last 10+ years I've purchased the without hood version of this jacket 2x. It's the most perfect garment I've ever obtained - does everything well. Whether by itself, layering, sleeping in a cool room, inside the house during cold/cool weather - it's the Swiss Knife of jackets. Thought I'd treat myself to the hooded version for cold dog-walk nights when something over my head would be nice. I'm sure I won't be disappointed; in fact, I'll be able to layer the new hooded jacket over the current hoodless (one size smaller) version.",

      comment: "Says it is ripstop and is mobile which it didn't live up to, highly recommend not using this jacket for anything other than going to dinner. Looks to be advertised as an active wear jacket but cannot hold up to basic daily actives like hiking or skiing. Ice rash is inevitable.",

      comment: "My husband hates wearing coats so I got him this and he was skeptical at first but he loves it! It's thin and comfortable and looks slim fitting compared to NF coats I looked at. It breaks the wind too which he likes! Just buy it and try it out you will not be disappointed.",
