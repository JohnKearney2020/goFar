  descriptions: [
    `The next-gen evolution of our award-winning four-season tent, nearly four years in the making. Guides Dave Hahn, Melissa Arnot, Adrian Ballinger, and David Morton played pivotal roles in providing critical feedback and continuous testing. Retaining the iconic strength and roomy living space of the original was essential. But we also increased the high-altitude usefulness of the living space, made the durability of connective points even stronger, and modified the rear vestibule to better protect gear while improving ease of access. New bombproof lash-down points, strengthened webbing, and higher-visibility guy outs make this new Katabatic a shelter equal to any elevation. And it's even a few ounces lighter than its predecessor. Tested for 18 months by our elite team of guides on Rainier, Denali, Cho Oyu, and Everest.`
